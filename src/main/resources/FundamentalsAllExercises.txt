       num = n;
   }
   Tricky inc() {

}

public class TrickyQuestion {
   public static void main(String s[]) {
       Tricky num1 = new Tricky(10);
       Tricky num2;

        this.name = name;
        this.author = author;
    }

13. Creating Abstract Relationships with Interfaces

Task 2

Which statements about interfaces are true?

Select the two correct answers.

(a)  Interfaces allow multiple implementation inheritance.
(b)  Interfaces can be extended by any number of interfaces.
(c)  Interfaces can extend any number of interfaces.
(d)  Members of an interface are never static.
(e)  Members of an interface can always be declared static.

ANSWER: Interfaces allow multiple implementation inheritance.
ANSWER: Interfaces can extend any number of interfaces.


Task 3

Which of these field declarations are legal within the body of an interface?

 Select the three correct answers.


(a) public static int answer = 42;

(b) int answer;

(c) final static int answer = 42;

(d) public int answer = 42;

(e) private final static int answer = 42;

ANSWER:
(a) public static int answer = 42;
(c) final static int answer = 42;
(d) public int answer = 42;


Task 4

Which statements about the keywords extends and implements are true?

Select the two correct answers.

(a)  The keyword extends is used to specify that an interface inherits from another interface.
(b)  The keyword implements is used to specify that an interface inherits from
another interface.
(c)  The keyword implements is used to specify that a class inherits from an
interface.
(d)  The keyword implements is used to specify that a class inherits from another
class.

ANSWER:
The keyword implements is used to specify that a class inherits from an
interface.
The keyword extends is used to specify that an interface inherits from another interface.



Task 5

Which statement is true about the following code?

// Filename: MyClass.java
abstract class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
 public void f() { }
 public void g() { }
}
interface Interface1 {
 int VAL_A = 1;
 int VAL_B = 2;
 void f();
 void g();
}
interface Interface2 { int VAL_B = 3;
 int VAL_C = 4;
 void g();
 void h();
}


Select the one correct answer.

(a)  MyClass only implements Interface1. Implementation for void h() fromInterface2 is missing.
(b)  The declarations of void g() in the two interfaces conflict, therefore, the code will not compile.
(c) The declarations of int VAL_B in the two interfaces conflict, therefore, the code will not compile.
(d) Nothing is wrong with the code, it will compile without errors.

ANSWER: (d) Nothing is wrong with the code, it will compile without errors.

Task 2

What would be the result of compiling and running the following program?
class MyClass {
 static MyClass ref;
 String[] arguments;

    ref.func(args);
 }

 public void func(String[] args) {
    ref.arguments = args;
 }
}

Select the one correct answer.
(a)  The program will fail to compile, since the static method main() cannot have a call to the non-static method func().
(b)  The program will fail to compile, since the non-static method func() cannot access the static variable ref.
(c)  The program will fail to compile, since the argument args passed to the static method main() cannot be passed to the non-static method func().
(d)  The program will compile, but will throw an exception when run.
(e)  The program will compile and run successfully.

ANSWER: (e)  The program will compile and run successfully.
